Sudoku Solver Using Dancing Links (DLX) Algorithm in JavaScript
This project implements a Sudoku solver based on Donald Knuthâ€™s Dancing Links (DLX) algorithm, an efficient method for solving exact cover problems. It transforms the Sudoku puzzle into an exact cover problem and uses DLX to find one or more solutions.

Features
Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle

Utilizes the Dancing Links algorithm for fast backtracking and efficient pruning

Handles multiple solutions and reports if more than one solution exists

Accepts incomplete Sudoku grids and fills in all missing values

Pure JavaScript implementation suitable for web applications
